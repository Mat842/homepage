# Mateusz Kornacki - My first website

## Demo

https://mat842.github.io/homepage/

## Description

#### This page is dedicated to Robert Lewandowski

He is considered one of the best footballers of his generation in the world and one of best middles.
I admire him because he proved that hard work combined with passion for what you do can bring success.

## To create this website I use the following technologies:
- HTML - markup language,
- CSS - style sheet language,
- JAVA SCRIPT - programing language,
- I used BEM convention,
- ES 6+ features,
- I used to a normalizer version - 8.0.1,
- I used to a font with family - Montserrat,
- A button appeared on the page that, when pressed, hides the photo.
